                <h3>Bulging-Eyes</h3>
                <p>Exophthalmos, also known as proptosis, is the medical term for bulging or protruding eyeballs. It can affect 1 or both eyes and is most often caused by thyroid eye disease.

If you have exophthalmos, there is a small risk of your optic nerve (which sends signals between your eye and brain) becoming compressed, which may affect your sight permanently if it is not treated quickly.
Many of the symptoms of thyroid eye disease tend to improve over time, although this can take several years. There's a chance your eyes will continue to protrude if corrective surgery is not done.

Some people with exophthalmos are left with long-term vision problems, such as double vision. However, permanent loss of vision is rare if the condition is diagnosed and treated quickly.

                <h3>Cataract</h3>
                <p>A cataract develops when the lens in your eye, which is normally clear, becomes foggy.

                    For your eye to see, light passes through a clear lens. The lens is behind your iris (colored part of your eye). The lens focuses the light so that your brain and eye can work together to
                     process information into a picture.

                    When a cataract clouds over the lens, your eye can’t focus
                    light in the same way. This leads to blurry vision or other vision loss (trouble seeing).
                     Your vision change depends on the cataract’s location and size.
                     Most people start getting cataracts around age 40. But you probably won’t notice symptoms until after age 60. Rarely, babies are born with cataracts due to a birth defect.

                     You’re more likely to develop cataracts if you:

                     Smoke cigarettes.
                     Live in an area with bad air pollution.
                     Use alcohol heavily.
                     Have a family history of cataracts.</p>

                <h3>Crossed-Eyes</h3>
                <p>Crossed eyes, also called strabismus, is a condition in which your eyes don’t line up. If you have this condition, your eyes look in different directions. And each eye will focus on a different object.

The condition is more common in children, but it can also occur later in life. In older children and adults, crossed eyes can be caused by a variety of underlying medical conditions, like cerebral palsy or stroke.

Crossed eyes can usually be corrected with corrective lenses, surgery, or a combination of both.

                <h3>Glaucoma</h3>
                <p>Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, the health of which is vital for good vision. This damage is often caused by an abnormally high pressure in your eye.

Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness for people over the age of 60. It can occur at any age but is more common in older adults.

Many forms of glaucoma have no warning signs. The effect is so gradual that you may not notice a change in vision until the condition is at an advanced stage.

                <h3>Uveitis</h3>
                <p>Uveitis is a form of eye inflammation. It affects the middle layer of tissue in the eye wall (uvea).

Uveitis (u-vee-I-tis) warning signs often come on suddenly and get worse quickly. They include eye redness, pain and blurred vision. The condition can affect one or both eyes, and it can affect people of all ages, even children.

Possible causes of uveitis are infection, injury, or an autoimmune or inflammatory disease. Many times a cause can't be identified.

Uveitis can be serious, leading to permanent vision loss. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent complications and preserve your vision.
